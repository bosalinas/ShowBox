## SCRUM 5/22/23

## What did we accomplish?
  API ideas from Bo, Jayne and Brenda
	  Work-life balance
	  API for movies
	  Regional plants
	  Pin Locations

## What do we need to review?
API Hints
CORS (cross-origin resource sharing)
Make sure API requires no-little authentication 
Return a JSON response, free & well-documented


## Delegate issues/tasks for next time?
Research IMDB to get titles and use watchnode for IDs 
## API ID between the two
imdb_id



## MVP
- input, search button, results for movie search and tiny bit of flare
